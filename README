VIM-LESSCSS

Vim plugin that make it easy to edit less files without need to manually update
corresponding css file.

INSTALLATION

If your don't have a preferred way to install Vim plugins, try to use
pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and then run:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/vitalk/vim-lesscss.git

WALKTHROUGH

Change this to the location of 'lessc' on your system, or define some additional
arguments when 'lessc' is called:

" less to css executable(full path or simple executable)
let g:lesscss_cmd = '/usr/bin/env lessc'

Just open your 'less' file in Vim and edit it. On save corresponding 'css' file
will be created with the same name as original. If your want to save the output
'css' files anywhere else add to your 'vimrc':

" save css files to separate css folder(relative to original less)
let g:lesscss_save_to = '../css/'
