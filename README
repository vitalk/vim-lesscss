VIM-LESSCSS

Vim plugin that make it easy to edit less files without need to manually update
corresponding css file.

INSTALLATION

If your don't have a preferred way to install Vim plugins, try to use
pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and then run:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/vitalk/vim-lesscss.git

WALKTHROUGH

This is a partial tutorial, see ':help lesscss' for more details.

Change this to the location of 'lessc' on your system, or define some additional
arguments when 'lessc' is called:

" less to css executable (full path or simple executable)
let g:lesscss_cmd = '$(which lessc)'

Just open your 'less' file in Vim and edit it. On save corresponding 'css' file
will be created with the same name as original. If your want to save the output
'css' files anywhere else add to your 'vimrc':

" save css files to separate css folder (relative to original less location)
let g:lesscss_save_to = '../css/'

To toggle plugin just use the default key binding '<Leader>l' or remap it to
something nice.

" remap plugin toggle
let g:lesscss_toggle_key = '<Leader>.'

Or disable it by default

" disable plugin at startup
let g:lesscss_on = 0
