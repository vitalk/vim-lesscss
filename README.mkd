Vim Lesscss
===========

Vim plugin that make it easy to edit less files without need to manually update
corresponding css file.

**Note**. For projects which have a complex structure automate this task with [any of](http://gruntjs.com/)
[existing](http://gulpjs.com/) [task](http://mrbook.org/tutorials/make/) [runners](http://fabric.readthedocs.org/) (personally I prefer combination of [Grunt less](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less)
and [Grunt watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)).

Installation
------------

If your don't have a preferred way to install Vim plugins, try to use
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and then run:

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/vitalk/vim-lesscss.git
```

To install via [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) add to your
`.vimrc`:

```viml
" Compiles your less files on the fly
Bundle 'vitalk/vim-lesscss'
```

Walkthrough
-----------

This is a partial tutorial, see `:help lesscss` for more details.

Change this to the location of `lessc` on your system, or define some additional
arguments when `lessc` is called:

```viml
" less to css executable (full path or simple executable)
let g:lesscss_cmd = '$(which lessc)'
```

Just open your `less` file in Vim and edit it. On save corresponding `css` file
will be created with the same name as original. If your want to save the output
`css` files anywhere else add to your `vimrc`:

```viml
" save css files to separate css folder (relative to original less location)
let g:lesscss_save_to = '../css/'
```

To toggle plugin just use the default key binding `<Leader>l` or remap it to
something nice.

```viml
" remap plugin toggle
let g:lesscss_toggle_key = '<Leader>.'
```

Or disable it by default

```viml
" disable plugin at startup
let g:lesscss_on = 0
```
